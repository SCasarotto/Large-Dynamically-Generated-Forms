# Large Dynamically Generated Forms

Inside of /src you will find:

-   DynamicForm
    -   Simple dynamic form implementation.
-   DynamicFormOrganized
    -   Organized each part into their own components to better see how the tree renders and made them pure components.
-   DynamicFormOrganizedWithContext
    -   Added the use of Context to highlight how to reduce the number of components that must re-render.

To run this demo simply:

1. clone the report
2. `yarn install` at the base folder
3. run `yarn start`
4. Toggle which component you are loading in the `index.js`.
